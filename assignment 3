## Project History

### 2023-05-16
- Coming up with an idea for what program i want to do, something scenic.
- <https://create.vista.com/colors/color-names/blue-grey/> gives me the RGB code for the shade of blue i want for the sky.
   I will be using this website for all my RGB colour codes. 
  
### 2023-05-22
- Took a proper look at the videos on canvas provided by Stefan and had a look at example submissions and have decided to
  change what I want to submit. 
  
- I know I want it to be cat themed. I could do a cat platform game or some type of cat 
  collison game, or customise your own cat.
