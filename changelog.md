## Project History

### 2023-05-16
- Coming up with an idea for what program i want to do, something scenic.
- <https://create.vista.com/colors/color-names/blue-grey/> gives me the RGB code for the shade of blue i want for the sky.
   I will be using this website for all my RGB colour codes. 
  
### 2023-05-22
- Took a proper look at the videos on canvas provided by Stefan and had a look at example submissions and have decided to
  change what I want to submit. 
  
- I know I want it to be cat themed. I could do a cat platform game or some type of cat 
  collison game, or customise your own cat. 

### 2023-05-24
- I' having a look through the slides and one of the topics I came acrosee was collision detection. I am going to build a 
  simple program and built off that. 
  
- <https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/images> and <https://processing.org/reference/background_.html> helped me understand 
  in depth how to understand why i have to use sketch and how it helps the program to display an image.
  
### 2023-05-25
- Im creating images on adobe illustrator for my game and want to upload it but and having trouble with saving it as a png or a jpg.
- Decided to use image off of the internet to help save time. <https://media.tenor.com/UNaQFutfOF0AAAAC/banana-crying-cat.gif>
- Decided controls will be left and right arrows but I am having trouble because the image moves one pixel each time I press left 
  or right buttons.
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkrAC9JFbM> this video at 2.49 teaches me to resize my images withing the processing software.
### 2023-05-26
- changed the controls to mouse movement so whichever direction the mouse moves, thats the direction the cat moves. May change it back
  to left and right keys in the future but will start work on arrays now.
- working on figuring out arrays for the falling drops of tears but my code doesnt compile.
- Changed the controls to left key and right key, I figured out i put the cooman in the wrong section of the code. I aslo realised
  I can't write " x+ 10" after if statements, rather " x += 10" so that is moves as fast as I want.

### 2023-05-27
- Im having trouble getting the tears to fall randomly from the window.
- Aha! I finally got the arrays to work. I also change the size and colour od the tears using the colour codes from 
  <https://create.vista.com/colors/color-names/steel-blue/>.
  
### 2023-05-30
- Im having trouble with collision detection. I want only the cats head to collect the water.
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFT3-SG6fSg> This youtube video shows me how to add how many points on the screen and add them up.
  Although i need to have the program detect when it hits the cat first to actually be able to collect points.
- I understand I need to place a rectangle or a polygon ove the cat image to help aid collision detection but Im having trouble figuring 
  out how to place it over my own image/ code. 
  (<https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/circle-rect.php> and 
  <https://tabreturn.github.io/code/processing/python/2019/03/18/processing.py_in_ten_lessons-7.4-_collision_detection.html> show helped me understand.
